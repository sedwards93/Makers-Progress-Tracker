# Course goals
As part of my reflective learning process, I kept a log of my weekly goals during my time at Makers Academy. Please click on each of the markdown files to read about my thoughts on each week. My wider goals for the course were as follows:

## I can make software

-   I can TDD anything
-   I can program fluently
-   I can debug anything
-   I can model anything
-   I can refactor anything
-   I have a methodical approach to solving problems

## I'm equipped for long term growth

-   I manage my own wellbeing
-   I can learn anything by myself

## I help my teams succeed

-   I use an agile product development process
-   I write code that is easy to change
-   I can justify the way I work
-   I grow collaboratively

# Course Retrospective

I am confident that I have managed to hit _all_ of my wider course goals. Programming, however, is a continual learning process. I am still at the beggining of my career in tech and improving with every day I code.
