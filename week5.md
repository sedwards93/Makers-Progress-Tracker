# Week 5
## Goals:

 - Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs ðŸ™…
 - Build to a specification (rather than challenges) ðŸ’…
 - Run stand-ups and retrospectives ðŸ’…
 - Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow ðŸ™…
 - Give and receive meaningful code review ðŸ’…

## Plans:
 -   Read through the supporting documentation regarding [Splitting Epics into User Stories](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/splitting_stories.md) and [Development Workflow](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/development_workflow.md)
 -   Attend a process workshop
## Evidence:

 - [Bowling Score Card - Weekend Challenge](https://github.com/sedwards93/bowling-challenge-ruby)
## Comment:
This week saw our first group project with Maker's Academy. We were randomly assigned into teams of four and tasked with building an Airbnb clone using only a specification as guidance. Overall we managed to produce something quite comprehensive given the short time-frame we were allocated to the task. We explored the use of agile project management principles, regrouping several times a day for team stand-ups and retros. Going forward into future group projects, I would like to focus more on evenly allocating front-end and back-end tasks, since we did not manage to swap responsibilities as often as I would have liked. This project was also our first introduction into using a branch/PR/merge workflow, which was a little confusing at times. In addition to the group project, this week I attended my first process review, whereby I completed a simple Ruby problem in front of a randomly allocated partner, reinforcing best code practices and my ability to give meaningful code reviews.
