## Comment:

This weeks saw the introduction of many new concepts, most notibly the Model, View, Controller design pattern. Whilst before I was coding simple terminal-based applications, this week we learnt to build simple web apps using the Sinatra framework. We learnt the importance of splitting app responsibility between the MVC. Whilst I am happy with the progress I made this week, going forward I want to focus on my HTML and CSS skills so that I can make my builds more aesthetically pleasing.
