## Comment:
Creating my own testing framework was certainly the highlight of the week. Even though I am fresh to programming I am already aware of the [huge reliance and dependency](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/) we have on frameworks and libraries. Creating Aladdin demystified some of the magic of testing frameworks such as Jasmine, and allowed me to focus on improving my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript. That being said, I feel as though I lost a bit of the momentum this week, owed partly to the uninspired curriculum and afternoon challenge. JavaScript is FUN but badly written note app challenges are not! That being said I really enjoyed the weekend challenge, which inspired me to write this [tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/dont-worry-be-api-a18b318d86d6).
