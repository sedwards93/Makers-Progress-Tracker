# Week 4
## Goals:

 - Build a simple web app with a database. :nail_care:
 - Follow an effective debugging process for database applications. :no_good:
 - Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships). :scream:
## Plans:
- Read through the supplied materials.
- Work through the [SQL zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/) exercises to familiarise myself with SQL query syntax.
- Complete the [SQL murder mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) challenge. 

## Evidence:

 - [Bookmark Afternoon Challenge](https://github.com/sedwards93/Bookmarks)
- [Chitter Weekend Challenge](https://github.com/sedwards93/chitter-challenge)
## Comment:
This week we were introduced to the concept incorporating SQL databases into our web apps. Whilst I feel as though I gained confidence in generating user stories from requirements and setting up ruby web projects with SQL functionality, I still feel as though I have a lot to learn with regards to Object Relational Mapping and implementing more complex features of a CRUD system. Consolidating my learning from the bookmark challenge through completion of the weekend Chitter challenge proved incredibly valuable, and assured me that with continued use and exposure, I will be able to gain confidence using SQL in my programming.
