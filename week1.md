# Week 1
## Goals:

-   Learn the basic principles of TDD and be able to test-driving simple programs.  :nail_care:
-   Practice pair programming using the driver-navigator style.  :nail_care:
-   Follow best practices when debugging.  :nail_care:
-   Be able to describe basic OO principles, including encapsulation and SRP. :no_good:
	- I will carry through this learning objective into week 2. 

## Plans:

-   Pair on Boris Bike challenge with a different person for three hours every day.
-   Attend workshops on Debugging and TDD.
-   Work through recommended TDD practicals - Dice and PiggyBank, ThoughtBot TDD exercise.
-   Daily Reading - makers suggested articles, blogs etc.

-  Weekend Airport Challenge -  [repo](https://github.com/sedwards93/airport_challenge)

## Comment:
Today was my first week attending the Makers full time course. Straight away I felt as though the largest gaps in my knowledge were around test driven development and the use of RSpec. I focused my independent learning time on getting to grips with RSpec syntax and test-driving simple programs by completing the exercises listed above. Whilst I felt a lot more confident going into the weekend airport challenge, I still feel as though I could improve my knowledge on basic OO principles. I will take this learning objective into week two.
