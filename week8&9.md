## Comment:
Weeks 8 and 9 saw the second group project of our bootcamp, where we were tasked to create a Facebook clone using the Ruby on Rails framework. And wow! It was almost immediately apparent that rails is a completely different kettle of fish compared to pure ruby and Sinatra! The first thing we did was plan, determined to improve upon the lessons we'd learnt during our first group projects. Since Rails was new to all four of us, we decided to spend some of our time independently learning the framework. This proved to be a good strategy as by Wednesday we began writing our code with reasonable confidence. I was fortunate to be placed within a group with excellent work ethic, and we managed to produce something functional and visually appealing within the two week time frame. The main challenge we faced during this project was perhaps the fact that it straddled the Christmas holiday. We had ambitious intensions to continue working throughout the break, but only managed to coordinate a couple of Zoom meetups across the 3 time zones of our team.
