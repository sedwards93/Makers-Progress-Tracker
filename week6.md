# Week 6
## Goals:


-   Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript ðŸ’…
-   Follow an effective process for learning a new language ðŸ’…

## Plans:
-   Create a translation 'cheat-sheet' writing down all of my knowledge of common Ruby syntax and its equivalent in JavaScript.
-   Work through the [Explore asynchronicity and the event loop in Javascript](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/javascript_fundamentals/async_JS.md) and [Closures](https://hackmd.io/cIFsMAqISHqVHN_-p9hY0Q) workshops.

## Evidence:
-   [Thermostat Afternoon Challenge](https://github.com/sedwards93/thermostat)
-   [Bowling Score Card JavaScript - Weekend Challenge](https://github.com/sedwards93/bowling-challenge)

## Comment:
Week 6 threw a spanner in the works and led us astray from the comfort of Ruby. We were thrown right in the deep end with a brand new language, JavaScript. Whilst this seemed incredibly daunting at first, I was determined to keep my momentum up and trust in my coding ability. Creating a 'cheat-sheet' of direct comparisons between Ruby and JavaScript helped a lot, but ultimately continual perseverance and determination helped me excel in this week. The weekend challenge was to replicate the bowling challenge of last weekend but in JavaScript. This felt like my most productive week of the bootcamp so far and I have loved getting to know JavaScript and all of its wondrous asynchronocity. Fortunately getting to grips with Jasmine, a JavaScript testing framework wasn't too much of a challenge, as its syntax strongly resembles Ruby's RSPEC.
