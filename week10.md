## Comment:
This week shook up the Makers format as we spent each day working independently on improving our code quality and completing tech tests to help prepare us for interview. With two rounds of coach feedback on my bank test, I finally got it to a place where I was happy with it. However, the main thing I took away from this week was that there are ALWAYS ways in which you can improve your code.
