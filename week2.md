# Week 2
## Goals:

-  Use all of week 1's skills :nail_care:
-  Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage :no_good:
  -  I will carry through this learning objective into week 2.
-  Unit test classes in isolation using mocking :nail_care:
-  Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change) :nail_care:
-  Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback. :nail_care:
## Plans:

-  Improve upon my understanding of basic OO principles.
-  Read up on use of RSpec mocks and doubles. 
-  Unit test classes in isolation using mocking :nail_care:

## Comment:

This week saw the introduction of a lot of new ideas that I initially found very challenging. My knowledge of mocking and testing unit classes in isolation only really clicked whilst working on my weekend takeaway challenge. I will continue to apply these principles going forward, but will aim to do some extra practice regarding breaking classes up. Week two saw our first code review, and seeing and commenting on someone else's code has given me some ideas on how to improve my own code ahead of my next review.
